              Back in 2022, I decided to apply for internship at{" "}
              <SectionLink href="https://www.kutia.net/" label="Kutia" /> and
              tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web
              development. Fast-forward to today, and I&apos;ve had the
              privilege of building software for a{" "}

              My main focus these days is building high performance, accessible
              web applications for our customers at{" "}

              . I most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design
              and engineering meet â€” things that look good but are also built
              well under the hood. In my free time, I try to learn and improve
              the codebase by learning new technologies and implementing best
              practices.

              When I&apos;m not at the computer, I&apos;m usually motorcycling,
              driving, reading, hanging out with my friends, or running around
              my family owned car repair shop.
