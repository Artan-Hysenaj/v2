            Back in 2022, I decided to apply for internship at{" "}
            <SectionLink href="https://www.kutia.net/" label="Kutia" /> and
            tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web
            development. Fast-forward to today, and I&apos;ve had the privilege
            of building software for a{" "}
            <SectionLink
              href="https://www.i-aps.com/"

            and build large data collection systems such as{" "}

            My main focus these days is building high performance, accessible
            web applications for our customers at{" "}
            <SectionLink href="https://www.kapsurvey.com/" label="KAPsurvey" />.
            I most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and
            engineering meet â€” things that look good but are also built well
            under the hood. In my free time, I try to learn and improve the
            codebase by learning new technologies and implementing best
            practices.

            When I&apos;m not at the computer, I&apos;m usually motorcycling,
            driving, reading, hanging out with my friends, or running around my
            family owned car repair shop.
